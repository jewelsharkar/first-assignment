                            becoming a substance use and recovery treatment counselor. The profession is expected to
                            grow as more people seek treatment for substance abuse and as drug treatment programs become
                            an increasingly popular alternative to jail time.</p>

                            manage mental illness or cope with challenging life events. They can work in a number of
                            settings, including independently and within treatment programs. As more people openly seek
                            counseling and treatment for mental illness, this profession will certainly grow.</p>

                            demand for health care social work will grow as Baby Boomers age, making this a strong field
